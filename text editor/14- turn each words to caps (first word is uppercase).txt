make a ostringstream to store all lowercase content on and then copy it to our file

read each line from the file by fetline function
loop over each word in the getline string
convert all word characters to lowercase
convert the first character to uppercase
put the final word in the ostringstream
if this line ended, put newline (\n) in the ostringstream

copy all ostringstream to our file
